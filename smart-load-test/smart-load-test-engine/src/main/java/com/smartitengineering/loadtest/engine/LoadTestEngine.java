 * provided to the engine so that it can delegate test instance creation to it.
 * Thread manager should be provided so that it can manage all threads created
 * by the engine. Once all information are available start operations should be
 * used to start the testing. In order to reuse the engine please use the
 * reinstanteCreatedState operation. Test result is available only once the
 * test engine finishes its testing operation. Use the appropriate listeners to
 * get updates on test engine's state and its test cases states.
