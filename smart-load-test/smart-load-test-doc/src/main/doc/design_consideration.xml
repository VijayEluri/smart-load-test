      <title>What inspired me?</title>

      <para>We had to do perform load and stress testing of our JAX-WS API and
      tag libraries. In doing so we found different tools for performing the
      tasks we needed to for our purpose. For example, for web service we
      could have used soapUI, for tag lib tesing we could have used either
      JMeter or HttpUnit. Though the tag lib testing was quite obvious the
      JAX-WS API testing was not that obvious and we need to ensure the API
      was supposed to handle what its supposed to recieve. Doing so would have
      required writing over-complicated XML authoring, whereas it could be
      achieved entirely by pure Java code. So we also needed to be able to
      test them. Adding more challenge to it was being able to test creation
      of different entities with different randomized values and execution of
      different test cases with delay with respect to starting point. Also I
      wanted to perform all the tests from one platfor rather than using
      multiple of them; please note that all the tools mentioned earlier are
      great tools in their own but using them all together was a distant
      possibility.</para>

      <title>Goal</title>

      <para>The goal of the project is quite large in deed, but I want to
      achieve it in different steps rather than going for at once. So I would
      in fact represent the goal in a roadmap fashion.</para>
